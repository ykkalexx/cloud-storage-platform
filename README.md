# Cloud Storage Platform - Backend Focus

## üöÄ Overview

Cloud Storage Platform is a robust backend-focused web application that provides secure and efficient file storage, sharing, and management capabilities. This project demonstrates advanced proficiency in server-side development, showcasing skills in API design, database management, cloud integration, and implementing complex backend logic for file operations and real-time communication.

## üåü Key Backend Features

- **RESTful API Design**: Comprehensive API for file operations, user management, and sharing functionalities.
- **Advanced File Handling**: 
  - Chunked upload mechanism for large files
  - Efficient file metadata management
  - Secure file storage integration with AWS S3
- **Authentication System**: 
  - JWT-based authentication with refresh token mechanism
  - OAuth2 integration for third-party authentication
- **Database Management**: 
  - MongoDB integration with Mongoose ODM
  - Efficient data modeling and indexing for optimized queries
- **Real-time Capabilities**: WebSocket implementation using Socket.IO for live updates and notifications
- **Search Functionality**: Backend-optimized search with MongoDB text indexing
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular design with separate services for authentication, file management, sharing, and search

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend Technologies

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 integration
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO
- **API Testing**: Jest and Supertest
- **Other Tools**:
  - Git for version control
  - npm for package management
  - Docker for containerization (optional)

## üèóÔ∏è Backend Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **API Layer**: Express.js routes and controllers handling HTTP requests and responses.
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic implementation, separated from the API layer for better testability and reusability.
3. **Data Access Layer**: Mongoose models and repositories for database operations.
4. **Middleware**: Custom middleware for authentication, error handling, and request processing.
5. **WebSocket Layer**: Socket.IO implementation for real-time features.
6. **External Services**: AWS S3 integration for file storage.

## üîí Backend Security Measures

- JWT-based authentication with secure HTTP-only cookies
- Refresh token rotation for enhanced security
- Password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds
- Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
- CORS configuration to prevent unauthorized access
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Secure file sharing with customizable permissions and expiring links

## üìä Backend Performance Optimizations

- Database indexing for faster query execution
- Efficient handling of file chunks for optimized large file uploads
- Paginated API responses for handling large datasets
- Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
