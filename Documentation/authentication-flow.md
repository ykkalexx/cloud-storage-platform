# Authentication Flow Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the authentication process used in the Cloud Storage Platform. The system employs a JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication mechanism with refresh tokens for enhanced security and user experience.

## Registration Process

1. User submits registration form with username, email, and password.
2. Server validates the input:
   - Checks if email is already registered
   - Ensures password meets complexity requirements
3. If validation passes:
   - Password is hashed using bcrypt
   - New user document is created in the database
   - A verification email is sent to the user's email address
4. User receives a success message with instructions to verify their email

## Login Process

1. User submits login form with email and password.
2. Server validates the credentials:
   - Retrieves user document from database using the email
   - Compares the provided password with the stored hash using bcrypt
3. If credentials are valid:
   - Generate an access token (JWT) and a refresh token
   - Access token is short-lived (e.g., 15 minutes)
   - Refresh token is long-lived (e.g., 7 days)
4. Send the tokens to the client:
   - Access token is sent as an HTTP-only, secure cookie
   - Refresh token is stored in the database and associated with the user

## Token Usage

1. Client includes the access token in the Authorization header for API requests:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
   ```
2. Server validates the access token for each request:
   - Checks the token's signature
   - Ensures the token hasn't expired
3. If the token is valid, the request is processed
4. If the token is invalid or expired, a 401 Unauthorized response is sent

## Token Refresh Process

1. When the access token expires, the client sends a refresh request with the refresh token
2. Server validates the refresh token:
   - Checks if the token exists in the database and hasn't expired
   - Verifies the association with the user
3. If the refresh token is valid:
   - Generate a new access token
   - Optionally, generate a new refresh token (token rotation for enhanced security)
   - Update the refresh token in the database if rotated
4. Send the new access token (and optionally, the new refresh token) to the client

## Logout Process

1. Client sends a logout request
2. Server invalidates the refresh token by removing it from the database
3. Server sends a response to clear the access token cookie on the client side

## OAuth Integration (e.g., Google Sign-In)

1. User initiates OAuth login (e.g., "Sign in with Google")
2. Server redirects user to the OAuth provider's authentication page
3. User authenticates with the OAuth provider and grants permissions
4. OAuth provider redirects back to the server with an authorization code
5. Server exchanges the code for user information with the OAuth provider
6. If the user's email exists in the database, log them in
7. If it's a new user, create an account and log them in
8. Generate and send tokens as in the regular login process

## Security Considerations

- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a sufficient number of salt rounds
- Access tokens are short-lived to minimize the impact of token theft
- Refresh tokens are long-lived but can be invalidated by the server if necessary
- All token operations use secure, HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks
- Use HTTPS for all communications to encrypt data in transit
- Implement multi-factor authentication for enhanced security (optional feature)
